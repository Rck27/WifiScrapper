it runs using cromedriver

how to use it?, first you need to provide the list of address that the program will read (soon will be integrated with netscan)

it is stored in 172.* file (wildcards)

it will loop to each router address to find one that still uses its default password,  and dump its SSID and password into the timestamp txt

(CHANGE UR DEFAULT ROUTER PASSWORD DUDE, srsly)

whats next? idk, u tell me
